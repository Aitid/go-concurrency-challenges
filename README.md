# Go Concurrency Challenges

A collection of Go concurrency patterns and exercises to help you master real-world concurrency in Go.  

Each pattern is implemented in its own folder with tests that cover both happy paths and production edge cases. The goal is to write correct, race-free, production-ready code.

---

## Current Patterns

- `fanin/` — Fan-in pattern with context cancellation and proper goroutine handling

> More patterns coming soon: fan-out, worker pool, pipeline, rate limiter, etc.
